An Augumented Reality based Music Player System. It uses markers to play / pause the music instruments.

It uses barcode markers. If they are in view, the corresponding instruments will play their sounds and as soon as they are removed from view, they will stop playing.

Markers are also uploaded on github. If we want to run the program, we would need to print the markers and use external camera to make the project working.

Libraries used - AR-Frame and AR.js
